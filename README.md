Internship SMS is a simple notification system that sends SMS alerts about new internship opportunities.
It’s built with Express.js and Twilio, and uses a RapidAPI internship API to fetch the latest postings. Whenever you run the script, it checks for new internships and sends you a notification straight to your phone.
